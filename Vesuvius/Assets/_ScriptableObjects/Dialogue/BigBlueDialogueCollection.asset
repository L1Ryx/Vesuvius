    - 'Well, well... '
    - Don't remember the last time we had a visitor here.
    - But you don't look like you're from this place...
    - ...
    - The name's Big Blue. I was found with no recollection of my past life by a
      vagrant warrior in golden armor. They gave me this name and quickly left.
    - I've heard legends of an artifact deeper in this cave that can allow you to
      see your true self. Maybe that can help you get back home.
    - ...
    - 'I have no interest myself of course... I have felt only a single calling since
      I reawoke. '
    - The melodies that appeared in my head... I must perform them for the souls
      nested deep within the many catacombs of Vesuvius.
    - This is the only place I've ever known, and I am happy here.
    - ...
    - You're holding up my performance. Perhaps we'll talk again some other day.
