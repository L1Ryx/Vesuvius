Set on a reimagined Mt. Vesuvius, you are to uncover the mystery of a vanished cult that disappeared into the mountain years ago. Within its depths, you will traverse a series of biomes that defy logic — lush forests, icy caves, tranquil lakes, and more — all hidden beneath the snow. Reality often bends, leaving questions on what is real as you navigate shifting landscapes and uncover the mountain’s secrets.
