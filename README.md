## Demo Build: v0.0.1 Released 1/6/2025
This version showcases core mechanics such as movement, combat, exploration, and early sound design. It serves as a testbed for gameplay features and doesn't fully represent the final game's world, visuals, or story.

The objective is to explore the environment and interact with the systems while progressing to the designated endpoint. The expected playtime is ~10 minutes.

This is a work-in-progress demo, and you may encounter bugs or incomplete features. Save files are not supported in this build, so progress will not be saved if you quit the game. You can report a bug from the main menu.
