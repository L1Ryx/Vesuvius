    - 'Well, well... '
    - Don't remember the last time we had a visitor here.
    - ...
    - Ha. I'm speaking like I'm not a visitor myself.
    - I suppose I frequent these catacombs far too often.
    - 'But who can blame me? Something about this place wards off the beasts. '
    - With that thing on your back, I don't suppose you came here for refuge though.
    - ...
    - The name's Big Blue. I was found with no recollection of my past life by a
      vagrant warrior in golden armor. They gave me this name and quickly left.
    - 'I know, I know. I truly don''t remember anything from my past life, but I
      have felt only a single calling since I reawoke. '
    - The melodies that appeared in my head... I must perform them for the souls
      nested deep within the many catacombs of Vesuvius.
    - This is the only place I've ever known, so I must embark on my journey soon.
    - ...
    - You're holding up my performance. Perhaps we'll talk again some other day.
